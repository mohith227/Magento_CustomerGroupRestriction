# Magento_CustomerGroupRestriction

In this Module, we are restricting access to the customer groups for the CMS page, Category Page, and Product Page. To enable this module login to Magento admin then, store > settings > configurations > MOHITH > UserGroupRestriction > Set "Yes" on Module Enable. Select the customer group and the Pages to restrict for the Customer group. Set Â "Yes" on Enable Custom Redirect to add the custom URLs. Select the customer group and the redirection URL. If there is no entry in this section it will redirect to Home Page ( base URL). If the restriction is imposed on CMS pages kindly do not add the CMS page URL for the redirect URL
